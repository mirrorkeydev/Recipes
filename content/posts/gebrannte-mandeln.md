> These are a German christmas market treat, but the recipe has some kind of a learning curve and a lot of stirring :)

| Prep   | Cook | Serves |
| :----: | :----: | :----: |
| 1 hr | -- | 7 4 oz bags|

## Ingredients

- 400g sugar
- 400 raw whole almonds
- 2 tsp cinnamon
- 2 tbsp real vanilla (imitation vanilla will do the same job)
- 1 oz water 

## Steps

1. Mix the sugar and cinnamon.
2. Prepare a baking mat/parchment paper on a surface that can withstand high heat where you will later 'dump' the super hot almonds to cool.
3. In a large, stainless steel pot (spaghetti pot or similar) mix the sugar/cinnamon mix with the water and vanilla extract. 
4. Stir with a wooden spatula until everything is well combined.
5. Put on medium high (not high) heat, add almonds and stir constantly until all the liquid has evaporated from the almond sugar mix. This may take anywhere from 10-20 minutes depending on the stove. Always keep stirring.
6. Don't get discouraged when the previously creamy substance now looks all dry and crumbly. That means that the water has completely evaporated from the mix and the caramelization process will soon start.
7. Reduce the heat slightly and keep stirring. 
8. You will notice that at some point the sugar starts to caramelize on the bottom of the pan, this is the point when you need to make sure to keep stirring and keep the heat hot enough to keep the sugar melting but not too hot so that the almonds will burn. You may hear a 'popping' sound which indicates that the heat is too high and the almonds start to pop.
9. When all almonds are evenly coated with carmelized sugar, remove from heat and dump on baking mat. 
10. With the wooden spatula separate almonds that stick together, let cool and fill in little bags or boxes.
