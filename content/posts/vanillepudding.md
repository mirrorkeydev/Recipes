## Ingredients

- 500 ml milk
- 2-4 tbsp sugar (optional with sugar substitute like Allulose or sucralose or splenda)
- 50g corn starch
- 2 tbsp butter
- 2 tbsp vanilla extract
- 1 egg


## Steps

1. In a cup or glass combine the cornstarch with enough milk so that it will fully dissolve (ca. 5-6 tablespoon milk)
2. In a pot heat the remaining milk with the sugar, butter, and vanilla and stir constantly so it will not burn.
3. As soon as the milk starts to 'bubble' remove from heat and whisk in the starch mix, stir constantly and bring back to a quick boil.
4. Remove from heat and quickly whisk in one egg (this is optional but it will add a nice yellow color and support a thicker texture)
5. Serve in little bowls (hot or cold)

For a chocolate pudding, increase milk amount by 50 ml and add 1 tbsp of cocoa to the milk during heating stage.
