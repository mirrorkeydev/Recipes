| Prep   | Bake | Serves |
| :----: | :----: | :----: |
| 2 hr | 20 min | 20-24 rolls |

## Ingredients

- 1/2 stick butter (60g), softened
- 250 ml milk
- 2 egg
- 500 g flour
- 1.5 tsp salt
- 3 tbsp sugar
- 3 tsp dry yeast
- 60 g whole flax seeds
- 60 g whole sunflower seeds

## Steps

1. Mix very soft butter with luke warm milk and 1 egg in a large bowl. (the other egg will be needed later)
2. Combine flour, salt, sugar, yeast and seeds in another bowl.
3. Add dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and knead thoroughly. If dough gets too sticky, add a little bit of flower.
4. Cover bowl with a lid or towel and let rise for at least one hour (until dough doubled in size) at warm place (I usually put in oven and keep light on).
5. After dough has risen, place on flour dusted surface and knead one more time to form two long rolls.
6. Preheat oven to 350F (or 325 convection)
7.  Cut each roll in 10-12 equal size pieces and form to long worms roughly 1.5 cm thick (dust hands inbetween).
8. Form small knots with each and put on lined baking sheet at least 2 inches apart. (other forms can be braids or just rolls)
9. Make egg wash with 1 egg and one tbsp milk (mix with fork) and brush each roll with egg wash (this will give a nice golden shine).
10. Bake for 15-20 minutes or until the rolls are golden.
11. Let cool on a cookie rack or on a fabric kitchen towel.
