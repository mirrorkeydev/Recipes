## Steps
1. Prep all of the toppings into bowls. This can be done in the morning and then save the toppings for the evening.
2. Half an hour before you want to start eating, boil halved potatoes with skin until easily pierced with a knife, between 10 and 20 minutes.
3. Turn on the raclette oven and place the potatoes in a casserole dish on top with some butter, so they start roasting (see picture).
4. Set the table and serve immediately.
