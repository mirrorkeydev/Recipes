## Ingredients

#### "Noodles"
- 4 large eggs
- 8 oz cream cheese, **softened**
- 2/4 cup Parmesan cheese, grated
- 2 1/2 cup mozzarella cheese, shredded
- 1/2 tsp Italian seasoning
- 1/2 tsp garlic powder
- 1/2 tsp onion powder

#### Filling
- 2 lb ground beef
- 3 cups marinara sauce, divided
- 1 1/2 cup mozzarella cheese, shredded
- 3/4 tbsp whole milk ricotta cheese
- 2 tbsp minced onion flakes
- 2 tsp dried oregano
- 2 tsp garlic powder
- 2 tsp dried basil
- 2 tsp Italian seasoning
- Pinch salt

## Steps

#### "Noodles"
1. Preheat oven to 375°F. Line 3 baking sheets with silpat mats.
2. In a large mixing bowl, using a hand mixer, cream together cream cheese and eggs.
3. Next, add Parmesan cheese, Italian seasoning, garlic powder, and onion powder. Mix until all ingredients are well combined. 
4. Using a rubber spatula, fold in mozzarella cheese and mix until well incorporated.
5. Spread the mixture onto baking sheets, creating 3 rectangles in the size of the final lasagna dish.
6. Bake each pan on the middle rack for 20-25 minutes.
7. When the “noodles” are done baking, cool in the fridge for about 20 minutes and then cut into thirds. This makes three perfectly sized “noodle” layers for an 8.5 X 4.5 X 2.5 loaf pan.

#### Filling
1. In a large skillet over medium-high heat, combine ground beef, minced onion, oregano, garlic powder, dried basil, italian seasoning and a pinch of salt. Cook until the meat is browned.
2. Drain excess fat from pan and add ¾ cup marinara sauce to meat. Reduce heat to low and simmer for 10 minutes.

#### Combine
1. Pour ¼ cup marinara sauce into bottom of loaf pan. Top with the first “noodle” layer
2. Layer a third of the ground beef mixture. Top with ¼ cup mozzarella cheese and 3 tbsp ricotta cheese, and cover with another “noodle” layer. Repeat these steps.
3. Cover the top “noodle” layer with remaining ground beef, and mozzarella cheese. Sprinkle Italian seasoning over top. Bake for 20 minutes.

## Notes
- If the cream cheese isn't soft enough, you will have a bad time.
